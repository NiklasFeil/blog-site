# About me
Hey, welcome to my blog! My name is Niklas Feil and I am a Computer Science student. I am currently in my first semester of my Master's degree at the TU Darmstadt. Previously, I finished my Bachelor's degree in Mainz at the Johannes Gutenberg Universit√§t.

This website is meant to showcase most, if not all, of my meaningful projects I have worked on.

2. [Prop Hunt - Creating an online multiplayer experience using Unreal Engine 5](./prop_hunt.html)
3. [Raytracing an ocean using WebGL2](./raytracing_ocean.html)
4. [Programming a discord bot using Rust and Serenity](./discord_bot.html)
